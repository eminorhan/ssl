# Image-based SSL training and evaluation tools

The following self-supervised learning algorithms are currently implemented:

* [`train_tc.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/ssl/blob/master/train_tc.py): trains a temporal classification model on video frames.
* [`train_tc_av.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/ssl/blob/master/train_tc_av.py): trains an audio-visual temporal classification model on audio-visual frames.
* [`train_dino.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/ssl/blob/master/train_dino.py): trains a DINO model on video frames. The code here was modified from [Facebook's DINO repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino).

Please see the [`scripts`](https://github.com/eminorhan/ssl/tree/master/scripts) directory for usage examples.
